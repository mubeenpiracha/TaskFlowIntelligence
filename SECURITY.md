# Security Implementation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security hardening implemented for the TaskFlow system to prepare it for production deployment and beta testing.

## Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Completed)

### 1. Environment Configuration Hardening
- **Fixed**: Hardcoded URLs and insecure defaults
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added environment variable validation in `server/config.ts`
  - Dynamic BASE_URL configuration supporting both development and production
  - Secure session secret generation with proper defaults
  - Validation function to ensure all required environment variables are present

### 2. Slack Webhook Security
- **Fixed**: Missing signature verification allowing unauthorized webhook calls
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `server/utils/slackSecurity.ts` with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
  - Applied to `/slack/events` and `/slack/interactions` endpoints
  - Includes timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks (5-minute window)
  - Graceful handling for development environments without signing secrets

### 3. Rate Limiting Protection
- **Fixed**: No protection against DoS attacks and abuse
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `server/utils/rateLimiter.ts` with multiple rate limiting strategies
  - General rate limit: 100 requests per 15 minutes for all routes
  - Slack webhook rate limit: 60 requests per minute for webhook endpoints
  - Authentication rate limit: 20 attempts per 15 minutes for auth endpoints
  - IP-based tracking with automatic cleanup of expired entries

### 4. Session Security Improvements
- **Fixed**: Weak session configuration and defaults
- **Implementation**:
  - Secure cookie settings: httpOnly, sameSite: 'strict', secure in production
  - Changed default session name from 'connect.sid' to 'taskflow.sid'
  - 24-hour session expiration with automatic cleanup
  - Memory store with periodic pruning of expired sessions

### 5. Security Headers Implementation
- **Fixed**: Missing security headers for XSS and clickjacking protection
- **Implementation**:
  - Strict-Transport-Security header for HTTPS enforcement
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME sniffing attacks
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY to prevent clickjacking
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for legacy XSS protection

### 6. Debug Logging Cleanup
- **Fixed**: Excessive debug logging exposing sensitive information
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed detailed request/response logging from production paths
  - Cleaned up Slack webhook debug output
  - Maintained essential error logging while removing sensitive data exposure

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Rate limiting applied to all auth endpoints
2. Password hashing using PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
3. Secure session management with httpOnly cookies
4. Automatic session expiration and cleanup

### Webhook Security
1. Slack signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
2. Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
3. Rate limiting specific to webhook endpoints
4. Graceful degradation for development environments

### API Protection
1. General rate limiting across all endpoints
2. Authentication middleware for protected routes
3. Input validation using Zod schemas
4. Secure error handling without information disclosure

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Required for security
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_slack_signing_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret_min_32_chars

# Application configuration
BASE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
NODE_ENV=production

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_slack_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_slack_client_secret
```

### Development
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
# Other variables as needed for testing
```

## Security Checklist

### âœ… Completed

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2 (Future Improvements)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy security isolation
- [ ] Bot token rotation mechanisms
- [ ] Advanced logging and monitoring
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation handling
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Request size limits
- [ ] File upload restrictions (if implemented)

## Security Testing

### Recommended Tests
1. **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limits trigger correctly
2. **Slack Webhooks**: Test signature verification with invalid signatures
3. **Session Security**: Verify secure cookie attributes in production
4. **Authentication**: Test rate limiting on auth endpoints
5. **HTTPS**: Verify security headers in production deployment

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Monitor rate limit violations
2. Track failed authentication attempts
3. Log webhook signature verification failures
4. Monitor session creation/destruction patterns

## Deployment Notes

### Production Checklist
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Configure all required environment variables
3. Verify HTTPS is enabled for secure cookies
4. Test Slack webhook signature verification
5. Confirm rate limiting is working
6. Validate security headers are present

### Security Incident Response
1. Monitor logs for security violations
2. Have procedures for revoking compromised tokens
3. Implement alerting for repeated rate limit violations
4. Maintain audit logs for security events
